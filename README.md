# childmortalityrate_python
This is a basic analysis of UNICEF's dataset on the Child Mortality Rate of all countries in the world from 2000 until 2021. For other details, check out the notebook's comments.


The dataset can be found in https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/under-five-mortality-data/

The whole dataset has the estimated child mortality rate for all countries in the world from 1990s onwards. 
Note though that some countries have null values in the earlier years due to logistic concerns. 

Due to these limitations, the analysis only included data from 2000 and onwards. 

The notebook also includes codes for data visualization.
